## Overview

Installs Lua / LuaJIT / OpenResty + LuaRocks in a single step inside the `.lua` folder in the current directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> * `setup-lua` **DOES NOT** set environment variables. Please, read the [post-install tips](#post-install-tips) to understand what to do in order to have a working setup;
> * the CLI mode doesn't mask your secrets. Please, do not feed secrets to `setup-lua` to keep them secure.

On the command line (or terminal), `setup-lua` is aware of predefined environment variables to build and install Lua / LuaJIT / OpenResty + LuaRocks.

> [!TIP]
> 
> `setup-lua` also works as a GitHub Action (see the [GitHub Actions docs](./GitHub.md)).

## Introduction

There is support to install three Lua interpreters:

* PUC-Lua ([https://lua.org/](https://lua.org/))
* LuaJIT ([https://luajit.org/](https://luajit.org/))
* OpenResty ([https://openresty.org/](https://openresty.org/))

By default, LuaRocks ([https://luarocks.org/](https://luarocks.org/)) always gets installed, but you can turn off the installation (see [here](#install-lua-but-skip-luarocks-installation)).

### Install Lua, but skip LuaRocks installation

To skip LuaRocks installation, you must set `LUAROCKS_VERSION` environment variable to `none`.

* Unix:

    ```bash
    env "LUAROCKS_VERSION=none" /opt/nodejs/bin/node dist/cli/index.js
    ```

* Windows:
  * GCC: assuming that both `nodejs` and `GCC` are on your PATH environment variable

        ```

    3. Install Lua and LuaRocks

        ```batch
        node dist\cli\index.js
        ```

  * MSVC:

    2. Set `LUAROCKS_VERSION` to `none`

        ```

    3. Install Lua and LuaRocks

        ```batch
        node dist\cli\index.js
        ```

### Miscellaneous

#### Install Lua using Clang

* Unix:

  ```bash
  env \
  "CC=clang" \
  "LD=clang" \
  "AR=llvm-ar" \
  "RANLIB=llvm-ranlib" \
  "STRIP=llvm-strip" \
  /opt/nodejs/bin/node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

* Windows:
  * Clang: assuming that both `nodejs` and LLVM-MinGW tools ([https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw)) are on your PATH environment variable
    1. Launch `cmd`
    2. Set `CC` and `LD` to `clang`

        ```batch
        SET "CC=clang"
        SET "LD=clang"
        ```

    3. Install Lua and LuaRocks

        ```batch
        node dist\cli\index.js
        ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> Below, due a limitation in the build process of LuaJIT and OpenResty on Windows with MSVC-compatible tools, the build ignores `clang-cl`. Therefore, in the presence of MSVC, `cl` and `link` are used instead.

  * Clang-cl from MSVC:

    1. Launch Visual Studio developer prompt (`cmd` based version) for the architecture you want to build
    2. Set `CC` and `LD` to `clang-cl`, and `AR` to `llvm-lib`

        ```batch
        SET "CC=clang-cl"
        SET "LD=llvm-link"
        SET "AR=llvm-lib"
        ```

    3. Install Lua and LuaRocks

        ```batch
        node dist\cli\index.js
        ```

## Advanced Usage

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Below, each environment variable accepts a list of contents separated by a semicolon (`a;b;c`) $\to$ `a`, `b` and `c`. In case the content has `;` inside, you can escape it by placing two semicolons (`a;;aa;b;c`) $\to$ `a;aa`, `b` and `c`.

### Install Lua using additional cflags

* Unix

  ```bash
  env "CFLAGS_EXTRA=-DMY_GREAT_MACRO=1" /opt/nodejs/bin/node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

* Windows

  ```batch
  SET "CFLAGS_EXTRA=-DMY_GREAT_MACRO=1"
  node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

### Install Lua using additional include directories

* Unix

  ```bash
  env "INCDIRS_EXTRA=/opt/include/a;/opt/include/b" /opt/nodejs/bin/node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

* Windows

  ```batch
  SET "INCDIRS_EXTRA=C:\opt\include\a;C:\opt\include\b"
  node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

### Install Lua using additional ldflags

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Not applied in LuaJIT / OpenResty builds

* Unix

  ```bash
  env "LDFLAGS_EXTRA=-static-libgcc" /opt/nodejs/bin/node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

* Windows

  ```batch
  SET "LDFLAGS_EXTRA=-static-libgcc"
  node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

### Install Lua using additional library directories

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Not applied in LuaJIT / OpenResty builds

* Unix

  ```bash
  env "LIBDIRS_EXTRA=/opt/lib/a;/opt/lib/b" /opt/nodejs/bin/node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

* Windows

  ```batch
  SET "LIBDIRS_EXTRA=C:\libs\a;C:\libs\b"
  node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

### Install Lua linking to additional libraries

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Not applied in LuaJIT / OpenResty builds

* Unix

  ```bash
  env "LIBS_EXTRA=history;ncurses" /opt/nodejs/bin/node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

* Windows

  ```batch
  SET "LIBS_EXTRA=history;ncurses"
  node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

### Install Lua applying patches

In this example, we apply patches provided in the files `my-great-change.patch` and `my-small-change.patch` after fetching Lua / LuaJIT / OpenResty source code.

* Unix

  ```bash
  env "LUA_PATCHES=my-great-change.patch;my-small-change.patch" /opt/nodejs/bin/node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

* Windows

  ```batch
  SET "LUA_PATCHES=my-great-change.patch;my-small-change.patch"
  node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

> [!TIP]
> 
> When the patch starts with `http://` or `https://`, `setup-lua` treats it as a remote patch and downloads it automatically. Otherwise, `setup-lua` treats it as a path in the local disk (full path or relative to the current directory).

### Install LuaRocks applying patches

In this example, we apply patches provided in the files `my-great-change.patch` and `my-small-change.patch` after fetching LuaRocks source code.

* Unix

  ```bash
  env "LUAROCKS_PATCHES=my-great-change.patch;my-small-change.patch" /opt/nodejs/bin/node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

* Windows

  ```batch
  SET "LUAROCKS_PATCHES=my-great-change.patch;my-small-change.patch"
  node dist/cli/index.js
  ```

> [!TIP]
> 
> When the patch starts with `http://` or `https://`, `setup-lua` treats it as a remote patch and downloads it automatically. Otherwise, `setup-lua` treats it as a path in the local disk (full path or relative to the current directory).

## Post-Install Tips

### Background Information

At the moment, Lua aims to be C89-compliant without relying on any external dependency. For that to work as desired, Lua makes intensive use of environment variables. LuaRocks, the package manager for Lua, also follows this mechanism. Environment variables allows the user to supply configuration info for both Lua and LuaRocks.

For instance, Windows or Unix systems can find executables and applications once their directories are added to `PATH` environment variable. Moreover, Lua is aware of paths stored at `LUA_PATH` to find `.lua` modules and `LUA_CPATH` to find shared libraries (`.dll` on Windows and `.so` on Unix).

In CLI mode, `setup-lua` basically does the following sequence of steps:

1. download, then build Lua (or LuaJIT / OpenResty) and install the artifacts to `.lua`;
2. download and unpacks LuaRocks to `.lua`;
3. at the end, no environment variables are set, and you are left with a partially configured Lua + LuaRocks setup.

### Finish the Configuration

In order to finish the Lua + LuaRocks setup, you have to set `PATH`, `LUA_PATH` and `LUA_CPATH` environment variables. Fortunately, LuaRocks provides a command to ease this step (`luarocks path`).

* Windows: on `cmd`, the following sequence of commands can get the job done

  ```cmd
  .lua\bin\luarocks path> vars.bat
  vars.bat
  del vars.bat
  ```

* Unix: on your shell, the following command does the job:

  ```bash
  eval $(.lua/bin/luarocks path)
  ```

Run these commands above everytime the command prompt or terminal is opened. Alternatively, on Windows, open the file `vars.bat` generated above and edit your system environment variables to persist them. On Unix, the command `eval $(.lua/bin/luarocks path)` can be persisted in the profile of your shell (`.bashrc` for `bash`, `.zshrc` for `zsh` and so on) to turn on these changes automatically.

### Cleaning the Room

During the development of Lua modules integrated to LuaRocks, it makes sense to repeat the installation under different toolchains. To clean the environment, be sure to launch a new command prompt or terminal and perform the following steps:

1. Remove the installation directory: `IF EXIST .lua\. RMDIR /S /Q .lua` on Windows or `rm -rf .lua` on Unix;
2. **Caution**: Remove previously installed LuaRocks packages (Windows-only):

  ```cmd
  IF EXIST "%APPDATA%\luarocks\." RMDIR /S /Q "%APPDATA%\luarocks"
  ```

3. Edit and undo environment variables (`LUA_PATH` and `LUA_CPATH`) set earlier while finishing the configuration.
